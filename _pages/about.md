I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Engineering at the University of Warwick. Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at Warwick working on the core research project of [the EPSRC Supergen ORE Hub](https://www.supergen-ore.net). I obtained bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2015, and master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2018. I obtained my PhD in Engineering at the University of Warwick in 2021, funded by [the H2020 ConFlex project](https://www.conflex.org) and working on the machine learning based modelling and control of wind turbine structures and wind farm wakes.
