I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Engineering at the University of Warwick. Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at Warwick working on the core research project of the EPSRC [Supergen ORE Hub](https://www.supergen-ore.net). I obtained bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2015, and master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2018. I obtained my PhD in Engineering at the University of Warwick in 2021, funded by the H2020 [ConFlex](https://www.conflex.org) project.

Research
======
My research interests are in physics-informed machine learning, AI for fluid dynamics, ML-based modeling, prediction, and control of complex fluid flows, and their applications on renewable energy systems e.g. wind energy and ocean energy.
